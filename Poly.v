(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (flat_map) *)
(** The function [map] maps a [list X] to a [list Y] using a function

    which maps a [list X] to a [list Y] using a function [f] of type
    [X -> list Y].  Your definition should work by 'flattening' the
    results of [f], like so:
        flat_map (fun n => [n;n+1;n+2]) [1;5;10]
      = [1; 2; 3; 5; 6; 7; 10; 11; 12].

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, optional (implicit_args) *)
(** The definitions and uses of [filter] and [map] use implicit
    arguments in many places.  Replace the curly braces around the
    implicit arguments with parentheses, and then fill in explicit
    type parameters where necessary and use Coq to check that you've
    done so correctly.  (This exercise is not to be turned in; it is
    probably easiest to do it on a _copy_ of this file that you can
    throw away afterwards.)  [] *)

(** ** Fold *)

(** An even more powerful higher-order function is called
    [fold].  This function is the inspiration for the "[reduce]"
    operation that lies at the heart of Google's map/reduce
    distributed programming framework. *)

Fixpoint fold {X Y:Type} (f: X->Y->Y) (l:list X) (b:Y) : Y :=
  match l with
  | nil => b
  | h :: t => f h (fold f t b)
  end.

(** *** *)

(** Intuitively, the behavior of the [fold] operation is to
    insert a given binary operator [f] between every pair of elements
    in a given list.  For example, [ fold plus [1;2;3;4] ] intuitively
    means [1+2+3+4].  To make this precise, we also need a "starting
    element" that serves as the initial second input to [f].  So, for
    example,
   fold plus [1;2;3;4] 0
    yields
   1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 0))).
    Here are some more examples:

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, advanced (fold_types_different) *)
(** Observe that the type of [fold] is parameterized by _two_ type
    variables, [X] and [Y], and the parameter [f] is a binary operator
    that takes an [X] and a [Y] and returns a [Y].  Can you think of a
    situation where it would be useful for [X] and [Y] to be
    different? *)

(** ** Functions For Constructing Functions *)

(** Most of the higher-order functions we have talked about so
    far take functions as _arguments_.  Now let's look at some
    examples involving _returning_ functions as the results of other
    functions.

    To begin, here is a function that takes a value [x] (drawn from
    some type [X]) and returns a function from [nat] to [X] that
    yields [x] whenever it is called, ignoring its [nat] argument. *)

Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example constfun_example2 : (constfun 5) 99 = 5.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** *** *)
(** Similarly, but a bit more interestingly, here is a function
    that takes a function [f] from numbers to some type [X], a number
    [k], and a value [x], and constructs a function that behaves
    exactly like [f] except that, when called with the argument [k],
    it returns [x]. *)

Definition override {X: Type} (f: nat->X) (k:nat) (x:X) : nat->X:=
  fun (k':nat) => if beq_nat k k' then x else f k'.

(** For example, we can apply [override] twice to obtain a
    function from numbers to booleans that returns [false] on [1] and
    [3] and returns [true] on all other arguments. *)

(** Before starting to work on the following proof, make sure you

(** We'll use function overriding heavily in parts of the rest of the
    course, and we will end up needing to know quite a bit about its
    properties.  To prove these properties, though, we need to know
    about a few more of Coq's tactics; developing these is the main
    topic of the next chapter.  For now, though, let's introduce just
    one very useful tactic that will also help us with proving
    properties of some of the other functions we have introduced in
    this chapter. *)

(* ###################################################### *)

(* ###################################################### *)
(** * The [unfold] Tactic *)

(** Sometimes, a proof will get stuck because Coq doesn't
    automatically expand a function call into its definition.  (This
    is a feature, not a bug: if Coq automatically expanded everything
    possible, our proof goals would quickly become enormous -- hard to
    read and slow for Coq to manipulate!) *)

Theorem unfold_example_bad : forall m n,
  3 + n = m ->
  plus3 n + 1 = m + 1.
Proof.
  intros m n H.
(* At this point, we'd like to do [rewrite -> H], since 
     [plus3 n] is definitionally equal to [3 + n].  However, 
     Coq doesn't automatically expand [plus3 n] to its 
     definition. *)
  Abort.

(** The [unfold] tactic can be used to explicitly replace a
    defined name by the right-hand side of its definition.  *)

  3 + n = m ->
  plus3 n + 1 = m + 1.
Proof.

(** Now we can prove a first property of [override]: If we
    override a function at some argument [k] and then look up [k], we
    get back the overridden value. *)

  (override f k x) k = x.
Proof.
  intros X x k f.
  unfold override.

(** As the inverse of [unfold], Coq also provides a tactic
